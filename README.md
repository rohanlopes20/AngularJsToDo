# :memo: AngularJsToDo

This is simple ToDo App using Angular JS. It stores the notes in localStorage of browser.

#### :bulb: Usage ####

Download and keep ToDo folder in server. I have added support for searching, adding & editing notes. Double click on any note to edit it.

:x: ~~Removed mansory js effect as it was not helping in editing notes.~~
